# Hey there, I'm Lavi Nigam! 👋

I’m an ML Engineer at Google, where I spend my days helping build the future of AI Agents—most notably working closely on the Agent Development Kit (ADK). But at my core, I’m just a chronic tinkerer, a builder, and someone who loves playing in the digital sandbox of GenAI.

Welcome to my personal corner of the internet!

### What is this place?

The world of Agent Engineering is moving at lightspeed, and keeping up can feel like drinking from a firehose. I created this blog to be a showcase of my personal experiments, a hub for tutorials, and a space for thought leadership.

My goal is simple: to explore everything new in the world of agents, break things, learn how to fix them, and distill all that complex chaos into simplified, easy-to-digest guides for you. Whether we are diving deep into Agent Engineering, exploring Harness Engineering, or just messing around with the latest multi-agent paradigms, I'm here to share the journey.

### The "Full Disclosure" Disclaimer 🚨

Let’s get the elephant out of the room: **Yes, I work at Google.** Because of my day job, I have the incredible privilege of accessing early-release versions of ADK, Vertex AI, and other cutting-edge tools before they hit the shelves. As a result:

1. **I will be building a *lot* of cool things with ADK.** It's what I work on, it's what I know, and I'm super excited about it.
2. **I will naturally have some bias.** My toolchain leans heavily into the Google Cloud and Gemini ecosystem.
3. **This is NOT a Google blog.** The thoughts, opinions, coding hacks, and inevitable bugs you find here are 100% my own personal views. They do not represent the official stance, views, or roadmaps of Google.

While I’ll be heavily leveraging ADK, I am not limiting myself to it. I want to explore the entire agent ecosystem. I promise to always be transparent about my biases so you're never misled, while giving you an authentic look at my personal experiments.

If you're ready to geek out over autonomous systems, LLMs, and building the future of agents, you're in the right place. Let's build something cool together! 🚀
